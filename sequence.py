# Input an integer "n"
# Instantiate the integer "a1 = 1", "a2 = 2" and "a3 = 3" which will be tracking changes in the sequence
# Instantiate the integer "sum_int = 0" which will be the sum of a1, a2 and a3
#
# for loop from 1 to n
#   Make the sum_int equal to a1 + a2 + a3
#   Make a1 = a2
#   Make a2 = a3
#   Make a3 = sum_int
#   Print out sum_int
